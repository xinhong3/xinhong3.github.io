This is an project for UIUC CS465 - User Interface Design, further details can be found [here](https://cs.illinois.edu/academics/courses/cs465). The project involved developing an Android app that offers remote start functionalities for vehicles, including engine start and AC control.

## Django Database UI

I developed a database management website for [MyH2O](https://www.linkedin.com/company/myh2o-water), a Chinese NGO dedicated to collecting village-level water data. MyH2O primarily relies on volunteers to gather this data, which is then analyzed to provide insights into water quality in underdeveloped villages across China. My implementation offers a portal-style interface, enabling volunteers to input data seamlessly from a centralized website and derive patterns and insights from it. The source code is proprietary and not publicly accessible.
