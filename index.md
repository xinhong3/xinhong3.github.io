I graduated from <u> the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</u> with degree in Mathematics and a minor in Computer Science. I enjoy learning new things, my current interests is distributed systems -- learning the formal methods of modeling systems and exploring various algorithms in this realm. Currently I'm also working with [Dr. Navida Wang](https://www.navidawang.com/) on projects in political science.

I enjoy paddle boarding, hiking, and Beethoven :)
